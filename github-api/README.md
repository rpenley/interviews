# Github API
# Write a RestAPI to Query GitHub

# Yes, this is just a wrapper for github, im as confused as you are
# I guess the idea here is that its useful to know how to wrap APIs
# and ocassionally manipulate them to do something different?
# At any rate this is also doubles as a boilerplate for a flask project
